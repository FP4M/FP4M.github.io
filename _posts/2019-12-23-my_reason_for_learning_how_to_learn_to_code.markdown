I worked as a salesperson throughout early adolescence and into adulthood. I was always a top seller and hardworker. However, I felt unfulfilled. I felt restless doing the same menial tasks day after day, and I wanted more out of life. I quit my job, and decided to start from scratch. I spent time researching other paths, but I still felt lost. 

I am someone who enjoys constant learning, solving complex puzzles, and self-improvement. But I didn't know how to channel all of this energy.

My girlfriend is a technical recruiter, and recently had sucess placing bootcamp graduates in roles. She suggested I look into coding. My first stop was Youtube: I watched a few videos, completed some tutorials, and discovered that I enjoyed coding. This was finally the challenge I was searching for. The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. So I joined Flatiron. I've learned a lot from Flatiron so far, but I know there will always be more to learn, which excites me. 

I am ready to take on my new career path, and I embrace the challenges that come with it.
